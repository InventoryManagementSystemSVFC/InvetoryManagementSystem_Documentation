# Project General Information

Group Name: Soliman, Cureg, Parico, Aldave
Project Title: Inventory Management System

## A. Problem Statement:

In the retail industry, managing inventory effectively is complex and challenging. Retail stores often struggle with issues like inefficient order management, inadequate reporting, and inaccurate processes. These problems can lead to stockouts, overstocking, lost sales, and higher operational costs. Without a streamlined system, manual errors, delays in decision-making, and resource inefficiencies are common. A comprehensive inventory management system is essential to improve accuracy, efficiency, and control over these processes.

Research suggests that advanced systems like RFID and methodologies such as Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) provide a high level of confidence in inventory records and help optimize stock levels (Munoz Macas et al., 2021). However, many small retailers may not be able to adopt these high-cost systems. For them, more affordable solutions like barcode systems and policies such as EOQ can still improve inventory management without the need for significant investments (Munoz Macas et al., 2021).

Moreover, the use of key performance indicators (KPIs) like inventory levels, product availability, and order frequency allows retailers to monitor and optimize their stock, ultimately improving decision-making and reducing financial loss. This further supports the need for a comprehensive inventory management system tailored to small and medium-sized retailers (Munoz Macas et al., 2021).
